It's an ingredient, just like salt. High heat sears, low heat tenderizes. Your first step to becoming a great cook is to stop following instructions and start *controlling* the fire.\"\ndisplayStyle: \"AI_IMAGE\"\naiImagePrompt: \"A glowing, ethereal flame hovering over a pan, with lines of energy radiating outwards, transforming a raw piece of food into a golden-brown masterpiece. The style should be slightly magical and awe-inspiring.\"\n---\nposterName: \"Captain Control\"\ntext: \"\\\"Controlling the fire\\\" isn't just about the knob. It's about the *pan*. A thick, heavy pan holds heat evenly. A thin, cheap one creates hot spots that burn your food while other parts are still raw. Your pan is your partner. Choose wisely.\"\ndisplayStyle: \"WEB_IMAGE\"\nimageSearchQuery: \"cast iron skillet vs thin frying pan side by side\"\n---\nposterName: \"The Flavor Architect\"\ntext: \"Salt isn't just about making things 'salty.' It's a flavor *enhancer*. It suppresses bitterness and makes sweet and savory notes pop. Think of it less like a spice and more like a volume knob for taste. The right amount doesn't taste salty; it makes food taste more like itself.\"\ndisplayStyle: \"BASIC\"\n---\nposterName: \"Veteran in the Trenches\"\ntext: \"You know why restaurant food tastes so good? They use more salt and fat than you'd dare to at home. I'm not saying you should go crazy, but if your food tastes like it's 'missing something,' it's probably salt.
